## Shared Task Objective 
The primary objective of this task is to identify and classify threats associated with violence, which can potentially lead to further incitement of violent acts.
The task categories are defined as follows:

- Direct Violence: This category encompasses explicit threats directed towards individuals or communities, including actions such as killing, rape, vandalism, deportation, desocialization (threats urging individuals or communities to abandon their religion, culture, or traditions), and resocialization (threats of forceful conversion). The detection of direct violence is crucial due to its potential to yield severe consequences in the future.

- Passive Violence: In this category, instances of violence are represented by the use of derogatory language, abusive remarks, or slang targeting individuals or communities. Additionally, any form of justification for violence is also classified under this category.

- Non-Violence: The contents falling under this category pertain to non-violent subjects, such as discussions about social rights or general conversational topics that do not involve any form of violence.

For this task, we have used Data Augmentation using the paraphrasing technique inorder to increase the size of the dataset.

Here we report performance of a few additional experiments which we have performed but their descriptions did not make it to the paper due to page limit. The purpose of reporting the performance here is to help the Bangla Natural Language Processing community to get an idea of how these models stand amongst each other with respect to this classification task.
